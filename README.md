# ChugSplash

A declarative and deterministic framework for deploying and upgrading smart contracts. Available for both Hardhat and Foundry.

Powers the [ChugSplash Managed Service](https://www.chugsplash.io).

> **WARNING**: The code and contracts ChugSplash uses to deploy and upgrade your contracts HAVE NOT been audited. ChugSplash is a BETA product undergoing significant active development. ChugSplash's behavior and APIs are subject to change at any time at our discretion. You should not use ChugSplash if you would be very upset with your project breaking without notice. We make no guarantees about the safety of any contract deployments using the ChugSplash system.

If you want to use ChugSplash in production, ask a question, or request a feature then we'd love to hear from you in the [Discord!](https://discord.gg/7Gc3DK33Np)

## Features

### ChugSplash Core Protocol
The Core Protocol includes smart contracts as well as Hardhat and Foundry plugins. All of the code is MIT licensed and is located inside this repository.
- Define deployments and upgrades [declaratively](https://github.com/chugsplash/chugsplash/blob/develop/docs/chugsplash-file.md#layout-of-a-chugsplash-file) in a single file, inspired by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
- Deployments are fully atomic, deterministic, and idempotent. Deployments cannot be halted for any reason and are finalized in a single transaction.
- Removes the need for initializer functions in your upgradeable contracts
- Built-in storage layout safety checker
- Deploys contracts at consistent addresses across networks using `CREATE2`
- Keep track of contract dependencies using simple template syntax (i.e. `{{ MyContract }}`).
- Generates deployment artifacts in the same format as hardhat-deploy
- Compatible with contracts deployed using the [OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/api-hardhat-upgrades) including both Transparent and UUPS proxies.

### [ChugSplash Managed Service](https://www.chugsplash.io)
The ChugSplash Managed Service is an optional product built on top of the ChugSplash Core Protocol designed to provide more advanced DevOps functionality for smart contract development teams.
- Manage projects, contracts, and deployments in a UI
- Approve deployments/upgrades with a single transaction through the UI
- Easy CI integration. Gaslessly propose upgrades to your contracts from your CI process. Upgrades are executed after your approval.
- Automatic Etherscan verification
